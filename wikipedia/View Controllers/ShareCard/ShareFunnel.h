 * For example, "entered_card" might represent the user tapping on a visually
 * presented card. Next, if the user attempted to share something, it will
 * either succeed (yay) or fail (e.g., if connection didn't work). It's possible
 * to infer from UIActivityViewController's setCompletionHandler block what
 * the outcome was should the user be presented with the official sharing
 * activities list. And in this case it makes sense to concatenate the success
 * or failure status along with the app activity as provided in
 * setCompletionHandler.
